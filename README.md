# Work Day Scheduler
This website allows the user to track events happening during various times throughout the day. The colors of the events change to display whether they have happened already, are happening, or haven't happened yet. Additionally, the current date is displayed near the top of the screen.

# Usage
To add an event to a time, type information about the event in the corresponding box, then press the save button.
